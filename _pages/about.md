I am an applied mathematics PhD student in the [Department of Mathematics & Statistics](https://math.unm.edu) at the [University of New Mexico](https://www.unm.edu). My research area is Mathematical Biology.

I earned my M.S. and B.Sc. in Mathematics from [Jahangirnagar University](https://juniv.edu), Dhaka, Bangladesh.  I have also taught various courses in a classroom setting. I have a strong passion for teaching and academic mentorship. I strive to create an engaging and inclusive learning environment that helps students build a deep understanding of mathematical concepts.

Equity and inclusion are central to my teaching philosophy, and I am committed to supporting students from diverse backgrounds in achieving their academic goals. Beyond my professional work, I enjoy traveling, exploring new ideas, and seeking meaningful experiences that enrich my perspective.
